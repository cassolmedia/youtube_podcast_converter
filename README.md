# youtube_podcast_converter
Really basic script I wrote to download youtube video podcasts and generate an mp3 for more comfortable consumption. 

I wrote it for a couple of reasons: 
1. I hate playing youtube in my car bacause it's a waste of data.  
2. I wanted listen to [Laymen Gaming's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwpmyAEOxIFmiXHFk4XbLMA) Weekly dump on the go.  

If I get bored one day soon, I want to add to this a bit.  Have it auto-download the latest episode when it's posted and whatnot.
